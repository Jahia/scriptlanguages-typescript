# scriptlanguages-typescript

A Jahia Digital Experience Manager (DX) module that provides typescript scripting language support. This module 
should mostly be considered as a proof-of-concept. It is not recommended to use this code in a production environment.

Encapsulates the `ScriptEngineFactory` from https://github.com/xafero/typescript4java. Since that code is not 
available on maven public repositories, you will need to download and build a local copy of that project before 
attempting to build this module.
